# Introduction 
Let's dive into Docker! Imagine you have this fantastic piece of software that allows you to pack up your applications, along with all the stuff they need to run, into a nice, neat container. Now, this container includes the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings—basically, everything required for the app to work seamlessly on any computer where Docker is installed.

Think of Docker containers as standardized units that you can easily create, deploy, and move around without worrying about differences in operating systems or other dependencies. It's like having a portable package that ensures your app behaves consistently across different environments, whether it's your laptop, a server in the cloud, or a colleague's machine.

What makes Docker so powerful is its ability to isolate these containers, keeping each application separate and secure. It uses a layered filesystem, meaning you can build your container by stacking different layers—like building blocks—where each layer represents a specific instruction in your application setup. This not only keeps things organized but also makes sharing and updating applications much more efficient.

Now, in computer science terms, Docker utilizes containerization technology, leveraging features of the underlying operating system to provide this isolated environment. It's an incredible tool for developers, enabling them to streamline the development process, enhance scalability, and maintain consistency across various deployment environments.

In essence, Docker simplifies the way we build, ship, and run applications, making the whole process more efficient, consistent, and scalable. It's like having a magic box that encapsulates your app and its dependencies, making it a breeze to deploy and manage across different systems.

# Basic comands
1. `docker run`: This command creates and starts a new container based on a specified image. For example:
   `docker run hello-world`
